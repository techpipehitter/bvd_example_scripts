# BVD Example Scripts

Python(2.7) scripts to help get started with Micro Focus Business Value Dashboard (BVD) version 10.12


I assume that these will work with newer versions as well, I just haven't tested it.


You will need to install requests and feedparser to make these scripts work.  pip has both, so it's super easy to install.
  * pip install feedparser
  * pip install requests
