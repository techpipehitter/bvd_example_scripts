# BVD Example Scripts

Scripts to help get started with Micro Focus Business Value Dashboard (BVD) version 10.12
I assume that these will work with newer versions as well, I just haven't tested it.

You will need to install requests and feedparser to make these script work.  pip has both, so it's super easy to install.
*pip install requests
*pip install feedparser
